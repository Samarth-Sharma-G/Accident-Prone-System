Accident Prone System is an accident-detection model with an object
detection algorithm as its backbone. Object detection algorithms are an
integral part of deep learning. The proposed system aims for optimal
automatic post-accident recovery, by deploying the latest open-source
computational technology at hand, in the surveillance and dash cameras
to detect accidents in real-time. Attempts have been made previously
where algorithms such as clustering, deep neural networks, and Regional
CNN has been used to create accident detection models but they
weren't able to achieve efficiency, real-time detection speed, or both. The
proposed system uses the latest algorithm at hand and a comparative study
is presented by implementing accident detection models with algorithms
such as Single Shot Detector (SSD) and You Only Look Once (YOLO)
which are way faster than traditional algorithms and also much more efficient
than their predecessors. Thus, the proposed system can be deployed for real-time accident detection and help save lives by faster post-accident recovery.
